 <h3>Introduction and Background of the Problem</h3>
<br>
  <p>In todays’ society, we are now called a global village as Marshall McLuhan have stated. We are now a world where everyone and almost everything are now connected in some way or manner of technology. In this technological advancement, social media was born. Social media or social networking sites like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, 9gag, Reddit, Snapchat, and countless more example of social sites are thriving and a lot of its population comes from the younger generation. According to analytics made by Alex York from Sprout Social 88% of both male and female 18-29 years old are using Facebook. As it stands now Facebook is the largest social media site with 1.15 billion active users each day.</p>
  <p>In this younger generation, the students are prone to spending their time on social media, may it be entertainment, gathering news, gaming, communication, and etc. As such, the researcher aims to know the effect of social media and how it affects the study rating of senior high IT school students of STI College Novaliches.</p>

<br>       

 <h3>Statement of the Problem</h3>
<br>
  <p>The statement of the problem of the researchers is:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>What are the effects of social media to the study ratings of I.T. students on STI college Novaliches?</li>
    <li>How many hours do SHS I.T. students on STI Novaliches spend on social media?</li>
   </ul>

 <br>

  <h3>Scope and Limitations</h3>
<br>
   <p>The purpose of this study is to determine if the social media use of students affects their study ratings. The Requirements to be respondents on this study are; the respondent has to be a Senior High School IT Student, Grade 12 students that use Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This study will only have respondents in STI Novaliches Senior High School IT Students. In general, the age group for this research is teenagers that age 16-18 years old. There are only 171 respondents only needed in this study. This study will be held on the STI Novaliches Campus Premises only. Our study would be conducted in a span of one semester.</p>

<br>

 <h3>
 <h3>Significance of the Study</h3>
<br> 
  <p>The researcher’s study aims to help determine if social media is a factor when it comes to the students’ habits on procrastinating during their study rating or perhaps if social media is taking too much attention to the student’s mind that they do not care a lot to studying. This study would benefit in the field of discipline of information technology as social media a computer-mediated technology is one of the variables of this study and that they may learn if social media affects the student’s study ratings and possibly help create a solution if the researchers thesis results turns out positive.</p>
  <p>The benefactors of the study are:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The students so that they may be aware of how much time they are devoting to social media and so that they could control it.</li>
    <li>The parents so that they may help reach out the student to let them know that social media is taking too much of their attention.</li>
    <li>The researchers so that they may know what social media can bring into our lives and to justify what would be the effect of social media in many students in this state of our generation.</li>
   </ul>

<br>
 
 <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<br> 
  <p>The variable of its study is study time of a student, social media and SHS students in STI College Novaliches.</p>
  <p><strong>(-) Null Hypothesis:</strong></p>
  <p>Social media has no effect in the study time of senior high students in STI College Novaliches.</p>
  <p><strong>(+) Alternative Hypothesis:</strong></p>
  <p>Social media has an effect in the study time of senior high in STI College Novaliches.</p>

 <h3>Conceptual Framework</h3>
<br>
 <p>The assumption of the effects of social media and study rating relies on what can student get from there doings. The perception of technology was a big impact in today’s society , that children can barely use it every time to communicate and to access information, while in the part of study time gives children learnings and possibly will affect the intelligence and behavior of it , also basing the assumptions from Vels University, Sara Selvaraj  a study entitled "Impact of social media on students’ academic performance" (2013) this study stated that the students should exploit and use it for a better life. They examine a questionnaire that has 100 study to determine the various factors of social media that have impact on students’ education.</p>

<br>

 <h3>Summary</h3>
<br>
 <p>In summary, most of the findings received that social media affects the student’s performance, and in some ways affect the state of their physical body, privacy, productivity, and etc. One study found that students because of social media loses privacy and distract them from academic work causing them to lose productivity (Osharive, 2015). Another study found that social media decreases their study time and increases leisure time and that social media is use mainly for non-academic purposes (Morallo, 2015). However, there are studies that suggest otherwise like Boateng and Amankwaa (2016) found in their study that the result suggested that social media contributed a lot to the development of the student’s academic life.</p>

<br>
 <h3>Research Design</h3>
<br>
  <p>Correlational research is a type of non-experimental research method, in which a researcher measures two variables, understands and assesses the statistical relationship between them with no influence from any extraneous variable (Bhat, 2018).</p>
  <p>It would best fit the correlation research design for this research because the researchers would like to know the relationship and how social media relates to the student ratings of a student.</p>

<br>

 <h3>Research Locale</h3>
<br>
  <p>The Researchers will conduct the research at STI College of Novaliches which is located at Diamond Avenue corner. Quirino Highway, San Bartolome, Novaliches Quezon City.</p>
 
<br>

 <h3>Respondents of the Study</h3>
<br>
  <p>The research population is from Grade 12 Senior High School at STI College Novaliches I.T. students for school year 2017 – 2018 which the samples are randomly selected.</p>

<br>
 
 <h3>Research Instrument</h3>
<br>
  <p>The researchers will use surveys and questionnaires as the tools to gather data.</p>
  <p>The researchers used survey questionnaires. On the top of the questionnaire is the schools’ name below that is an optional name input and besides that name input is the section that is required, under the name and section there are 2 profiling question that would help the researcher get information about the respondent like the frequency of usage of social media or allotted time spent studying and their grades last year below that is the Likert scale that would determine the extent of agreement or disagreement of the respondent on the question at hand. Survey is used for this study because this is the best way of interpreting the data that the researchers would procure. Survey is perfect for a quantitative research because the data gathered would be coming straight from the respondents. It would also be easier for the respondents to answer rather than the long process an interview could produce and the dangers of misinterpreting the data because of the nature of interview. At first the researchers did pilot testing on their classmates to determine if there was any need to redo or fix the survey questionnaire, how to properly conduct a survey and how much money would it approximately cost to conduct a survey.</p>

  <dt><strong>Students who use social media(introverts).</strong></dt>
   <dd>People who credibly use social media are the ones who can take the researchers’ survey, and it is indicated in the survey form If the students use social media, and it is answerable by yes or no.</dd>
<br>
  <dt><strong>Students who do not have knowledge anything about social media.</strong></dt>
   <dd>The researcher will take the concern and ask if he/she does not have knowledge anything about social media. In case, in that situation It will classify as the higher rate of studying time rather than using social media.</dd>
 <br>
  <dt><strong>Students who have gadgets at home.</strong></dt>
   <dd>In the researchers' questionnaire, it does not only talk about the social media, but it also contains a question about the study time of a student. The students may also use gadgets owned by anyone they know if they do not have gadgets at home.</dd>

r = 57.705 / √((170.781)(259.124)) = 0.2743<br>
Meta Numerics (cross-check)<br>
r = 0.2743<br>
The value of R is 0.2743. Although technically a positive correlation, the relationship between your variables is weak (nb. the nearer the value is to zero, the weaker the relationship).<br>
The value of R2, the coefficient of determination, is 0.0752.</center></td>

 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
<br>
  <p>The average grade of students last year were 85-89 although it is fairly-well  the result of pearson r suggest that there is positive correlation for the researchers alternative hypothesis. The average time spent by students using social media 3-4 hours somehow affected their student’s ratings. The researchers conclude that this research prove that there is a relationship between social media and it affects the student’s ratings. The researcher’s alternative hypothesis is accepted due to the positive correlation results it wielded by the Pearson R correlational formula.</p> 

<br>

<h3>Discussion and Interpretations of Findings</h3>
<br>
 <p>The respondents answered our survey said the SHS IT Students in STI Novaliches uses Social media (208 out of 210 Grade 12 SHS IT Students in STI Novaliches). Most students use Facebook followed by Twitter and Instagram. Last year’s average of former Grade 11 students were 85-89. The most average time the student’s spend on social media is 3-4 hours. Due to the five positive outcomes on the 5-point Likert scale questions the researchers conclude that social media indeed has a relationship in the ratings of students of senior high IT students in STI College Novaliches and it affects their student rating last year in some ways or form.</p> 
 
<br>

 <h3>Recommendation for further Research</h3>
<br>
  <p>The researchers of this study recommend to research on the correlation of study time and average grades of the students, to support this study. We recommend the students to lessen their time spending on social media so they could perform well and possibly get better student ratings.</p>
  
<br>

  <ul><h4>Benefits of this study</h4>
<br>
    <li>The students now can be careful knowing how much time they are devoting to social media and they could control it due to last year’s students rating.</li>
    <li>The parents are now aware that they can help reach out the student to let them know that social media is taking too much of their attention and it affects their ratings.</li>	
    <li>The researchers have knowledge on what social media can bring into our lives and justified the effects of social media in the ratings of students for this generation of this country.</li>
