 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
<br>
  <p>The average grade of students last year were 85-89 although it is fairly-well  the result of pearson r suggest that there is positive correlation for the researchers alternative hypothesis. The average time spent by students using social media 3-4 hours somehow affected their student’s ratings. The researchers conclude that this research prove that there is a relationship between social media and it affects the student’s ratings. The researcher’s alternative hypothesis is accepted due to the positive correlation results it wielded by the Pearson R correlational formula.</p>

 <h3>Discussion and Interpretations of Findings</h3>
<br>
 <p>The respondents answered our survey said the SHS IT Students in STI Novaliches uses Social media (208 out of 210 Grade 12 SHS IT Students in STI Novaliches). Most students use Facebook followed by Twitter and Instagram. Last year’s average of former Grade 11 students were 85-89. The most average time the student’s spend on social media is 3-4 hours. Due to the five positive outcomes on the 5-point Likert scale questions the researchers conclude that social media indeed has a relationship in the ratings of students of senior high IT students in STI College Novaliches and it affects their student rating last year in some ways or form.</p>

 <h3>Recommendation for further Research</h3>
<br>
  <p>The researchers of this study recommend to research on the correlation of study time and average grades of the students, to support this study. We recommend the students to lessen their time spending on social media so they could perform well and possibly get better student ratings.</p>
<br>
  <ul><h4>Benefits of this study</h4>
<br>
    <li>The students now can be careful knowing how much time they are devoting to social media and they could control it due to last year’s students rating.</li>
    <li>The parents are now aware that they can help reach out the student to let them know that social media is taking too much of their attention and it affects their ratings.</li>	
    <li>The researchers have knowledge on what social media can bring into our lives and justified the effects of social media in the ratings of students for this generation of this country.</li>
