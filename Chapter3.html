 <h3>Research Design</h3>
<br>
  <p>Correlational research is a type of non-experimental research method, in which a researcher measures two variables, understands and assesses the statistical relationship between them with no influence from any extraneous variable (Bhat, 2018).</p>
  <p>It would best fit the correlation research design for this research because the researchers would like to know the relationship and how social media relates to the student ratings of a student.</p>
 </div>

<br>

 <div id="Container">
 <h3>Research Locale</h3>
<br>
 <p>The Researchers will conduct the research at STI College of Novaliches which is located at Diamond Avenue corner. Quirino Highway, San Bartolome, Novaliches Quezon City.</p>
 </div>
 
<br>

 <div id="Container">
 <h3>Respondents of the Study</h3>
<br>
  <p>The research population is from Grade 12 Senior High School at STI College Novaliches IT students for school year 2017 – 2018 which the samples are randomly selected.</p>
 </div>

<br>

 <div id="Container">
 <h3>Research Instrument</h3>
<br>
  <p>The researchers will use surveys and questionnaires as the tools to gather data.</p>
  <p>The researchers used survey questionnaires. On the top of the questionnaire is the schools’ name below that is an optional name input and besides that name input is the section that is required, under the name and section there are 2 profiling question that would help the researcher get information about the respondent like the frequency of usage of social media or allotted time spent studying and their grades last year below that is the Likert scale that would determine the extent of agreement or disagreement of the respondent on the question at hand. Survey is used for this study because this is the best way of interpreting the data that the researchers would procure. Survey is perfect for a quantitative research because the data gathered would be coming straight from the respondents. It would also be easier for the respondents to answer rather than the long process an interview could produce and the dangers of misinterpreting the data because of the nature of interview. At first the researchers did pilot testing on their classmates to determine if there was any need to redo or fix the survey questionnaire, how to properly conduct a survey and how much money would it approximately cost to conduct a survey.</p>

 <h3>Samplings:</h3>
<br>
  <table width="fixed" border="2px">
   <tr>
    <th>Population</th>
    <td>STI Senior High School I.T. students from STI Novaliches</td>
   </tr>

 <h3>Sampling Computation:</h3>
<br>
 <p>The researchers are going to use random probability sampling. The researchers are going to sample overall estimated population of Grade 11 and 12 IT students. The researchers will be using the Slovin’s formula to calculate the sample with the confidence level of 95%.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Cl=100% - 95%</li>
   <li>Cl=5% * (100)</li>
   <li>Cl= 0.05</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Now that the alpha level is determined, the researchers can now proceed to Slovin’s formula</p>
 <p>Step 2.) SS= sample size / N= sample size / e = margin of error or alpha level of confidence</p>
  <ul>
   <li>SS = N / (1 + N e²)
   <li>SS= 102 / (1 + 102 * 0.052)
   <li>SS= 102 / (1 + 102 * 0.0025)
   <li>SS= 102 / (1 + 0. 255)
   <li>SS= 102 / 1.255 
   <li>SS= 81.27 or 81
   </ul>
  <p>The researchers' sample size is 81 SHS I.T. students from STI College Novaliches</p>

 <h3>Control of Extraneous Variables:</h3>
<br>
 <dl>
  <dt><strong>Senior High I.T. students only in STI College Novaliches.</strong></dt>
   <dd>The researchers will only give the questionnaires to SHS I.T. students in STI College Novaliches</dd>
<br>
  <dt><strong>Students who use social media(introverts).</strong></dt>
   <dd>People who credibly use social media are the ones who can take the researchers’ survey, and it is indicated in the survey form If the students use social media, and it is answerable by yes or no.</dd>
<br>
  <dt><strong>Students who do not have knowledge anything about social media.</strong></dt>
   <dd>The researcher will take the concern and ask if he/she does not have knowledge anything about social media. In case, in that situation It will classify as the higher rate of studying time rather than using social media.</dd>
 <br>
  <dt><strong>Students who have gadgets at home.</strong></dt>
   <dd>In the researchers' questionnaire, it does not only talk about the social media, but it also contains a question about the study time of a student. The students may also use gadgets owned by anyone they know if they do not have gadgets at home.</dd>
