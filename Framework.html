 <h3>Conceptual/Theoretical Framework</h3>
<br>
 <p>The assumption of the effects of social media and study rating relies on what can student get from there doings. The perception of technology was a big impact in today’s society , that children can barely use it every time to communicate and to access information, while in the part of study time gives children learnings and possibly will affect the intelligence and behavior of it , also basing the assumptions from Vels University, Sara Selvaraj  a study entitled "Impact of social media on students’ academic performance" (2013) this study stated that the students should exploit and use it for a better life. They examine a questionnaire that has 100 study to determine the various factors of social media that have impact on students’ education.</p>

 <h3>Summary</h3>
<br>
 <p>In summary, most of the findings received that social media affects the student’s performance, and in some ways affect the state of their physical body, privacy, productivity, and etc. One study found that students because of social media loses privacy and distract them from academic work causing them to lose productivity (Osharive, 2015). Another study found that social media decreases their study time and increases leisure time and that social media is use mainly for non-academic purposes (Morallo, 2015). However, there are studies that suggest otherwise like Boateng and Amankwaa (2016) found in their study that the result suggested that social media contributed a lot to the development of the student’s academic life.</p>
